# The Find Command
## Type
Ever wanted to search through a directory and filter the results based on the type of file? I present to you, **-type**:

```bash
find [path] =type [filetype]
```

This option allows you to search for files or directories of a specific type.

```bash
grep -r "Lucayans" -l
```

## Modification Time
Perhaps you wanted to filter files based on when they were created, modified, or accessed depending on a certain time range! I present to you, **-mtime**:

```bash
find [path] mtime [number of days]
```

This option allows you to search for files based on a specific number of days since they were modified.

```bash
grep -n "San Diego" Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt
```
## Size 
Files all have different sizes. You can use the find command to filter based on their size! I present to you: **-size**:

```bash
find [path] -size [size][unit]
```
This option allows you to search for files based on their size.

```bash
grep -m2 "San Diego" ./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/*.txt
```

## Empty
Perhaps you have a ton of files that you wanna clean up, but you want to be careful. You can use: **-empty**:

```bash
find [path] -empty
```
This option allows you to search for empty files or directories.
```bash
grep -c "Italy" ./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt
```
